On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here.
He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth but, on the other hand,
nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him,
as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room to watch television with his aunt and uncle.
Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle, suddenly spoke.
'Glad to see the boy's stopped trying to butt in. Where is he, anyway?'
'I don't know,' said Aunt Petunia, unconcerned. 'Not in the house.'
Uncle Vernon grunted.
As far as I remember, I used to be a jedi a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.
Feeling all the love I swear that itâ€™s in the air, Leaving me, floating forever, into infinity.
Quantum fluctuations project into the air, Leaving me floating forever into infinity.
