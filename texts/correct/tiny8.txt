Today though it's not jobs that are lacking but housing. Stephan says the political mood has changed and now he's being targeted.
"They are making us scapegoats for the failures of government policy. They sold lots of social housing and now we are being held responsible for their bad housing decisions," he tells me.
"Usually in German society you have these social housing programmes. You have special buildings with cheap rents, or you have subsidies.
"But they sold many of these buildings. So the government has made the problem it's now facing."
In June the courts will decide if Stephan can be exempted from the ban. Otherwise his business will close and six people will lose their jobs.
