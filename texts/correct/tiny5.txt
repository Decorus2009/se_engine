"First we check the buzzers at the building's front door," explains Karsten. "Often that shows something like 'holiday flat 1' rather than a surname."
A neighbour entering the building goes in and we follow behind, go up the stairs and ring the bell of the suspected illegal holiday flat: no answer.
So Diana rings the bell of a neighbour, shows her government ID to the smiling young women who opens the door, and explains that she's part of a team trying to stamp out illegal holiday lets.
"It can get pretty noisy," the neighbour says nodding. "I don't think there's anyone there at the moment, but there was last week."
Another neighbour says seven young tourists stayed in the one-bedroom flat last week. She's had enough of the all-night partying and never knowing who's in the building.
