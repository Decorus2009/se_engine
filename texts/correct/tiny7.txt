"If you have to decide between tourists or families, it's the people who live here we have to take care of first," says Stephan von Dassel, deputy mayor for Berlin's district of Mitte, who is one of those behind the law.
Usually people think of Germany as pro-free market and of letting business operate without intervention from the state. But Stephan von Dassel argues that the social welfare of the wider community trumps the individual rights of some businesses or property owners.
Vacation apartment owners don't agree. In a pretty red-brick courtyard, surrounded by plants in terracotta pots, I meet another Stephan, Stephan la Barre.
These were once stables and derelict factory buildings in a socially deprived area of Berlin. But 12 years ago Stephan invested millions converting the site into 15 small holiday apartments for families.
At the time Germany was known as the sick man of Europe and Berlin was plagued by high unemployment and poverty. So the local authorities encouraged Stephan's project.
