The angry backlash from the release of the video led to Emanuel firing his police superintendent Garry McCarthy and played big role in Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez losing her March primary.

The officer, Jason Van Dyke, was charged with first degree murder on the same day as the video’s release — 400 days after the incident. The Justice Department also launched a civil rights investigation of the police department’s practices in the aftermath of the video’s release.

The political pressure has not subsided for Emanuel. Sixty-two percent of Chicagoans disapprove of Emanuel’s job performance, while 25% approved, according a Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll published last week.

Emanuel appointed a task force on policing soon after the video’s release. That task force last month issued more than 100 recommendations that it said the department needed to take to help win back the public trust. The mayor’s handpicked task force also concluded that the city’s police department is beset my systemic racism.
