The dump at Sesena, a town where 20,000 people live, is thought to be the largest in Europe. It stretches over 25 acres (10,000 sq metres).
The Madrid government said on Friday evening that the city's air quality had not registered any change from the fire in the nearby town.

'Not chance'
The president of the regional government, Emiliano Garcia-Page, visited the town on Friday.
He said: "I've been talking to the two petrol station workers who raised the alarm, and they told me that the fire started on one side of the dump, which makes us think it was not a chance occurrence. Besides, it was not that hot last night.
"But for now we are not drawing any conclusions."

The regional government said it was a "toxic cloud" and could affect part of the town.
Drivers on roads nearby have been told to keep their car windows up as the smoke may damage their health.
Flight departures and arrivals at Madrid airport have not been affected.
The sprawling dump has attracted criticism from locals and environmentalists for years.
