But while that makes the law popular, that isn't the reason why Berlin's city government has decided to ban most holiday apartments. It's because of rising rents and a growing lack of housing in the city.
Between 2009 and 2014 rents shot up by 56% in Berlin.
And the city has become a magnet for young creatives from all over the world, so Berlin's growing population means it's increasingly difficult to find affordable housing.
The influx of more than a million migrants and refugees to Germany in 2015 is adding to the challenge.
Many blame holiday flats for exacerbating the problem by taking apartments off the market. Letting out an apartment to tourists for a few days can sometimes earn you as much as a typical rent for a month.
The accusation is that holiday lets are pushing up rental prices for local people.
The city's move is popular with many. "I really agree with it," says Anna, a student in her twenties who was born in Berlin.
"Air BnB is a rip off for tourists. I think the cheap flats should be for people who really need them like refugees and single mothers and people who work in Berlin."
