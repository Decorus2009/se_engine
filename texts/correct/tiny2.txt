People living near a "toxic cloud" from a burning tyre dump near the Spanish capital Madrid have been told to leave their homes.
Local officials ordered the evacuation of the Quinon de Sesena area, where 9,000 people live, saying human health might be at risk.
However, many residents have already left their homes and it is thought that just 1,000 people are still there.
Investigators believe the fire was started deliberately early on Friday.

Emergency services were called to the town of Sesena, 35 km (22 miles) south of Madrid, at 01:00 local time (23:00 GMT on Thursday).
They sent 10 teams of fire-fighters, who have battled the blaze all day.
