"We love holiday apartments. And we've done that for years," says one man from southern Germany who's visiting Berlin with his family.
"I think it's a real shame. And I don't understand how the government can say this is suddenly how it is, but that before it was different. It's difficult to comprehend."
"You should be allowed to carry on renting them," says one elderly woman who's here with her husband. "The government should think again, and scrap the ban."
Meanwhile back at the suspected illegal holiday apartment, Diana chats to the neighbours as if she's known them for years - nodding and commiserating with them over the problems caused by noisy neighbours.
She's more like a counsellor than a government inspector.
As she hands out her business card all the neighbours say they will definitely contact her the next time the apartment is let out to tourists.
