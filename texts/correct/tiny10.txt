CHICAGO — Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Friday announced plans for a major overhaul of how oversight of the troubled Chicago Police Department should be conducted.

Emanuel wrote the broad outlines of his proposal in an op-ed piece in the Chicago Sun-Times, touting his plan as one that will “fundamentally reshape our system of police accountability”

The most significant change in his proposal is scrapping the controversial Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), which is tasked with investigating police-involved shootings and allegations of major police conduct, and replacing it with a new civilian agency.

IPRA has conducted more than 400 investigations of police-involved shootings since 2008, but only found wrongdoing in two instances. Chicago’s city council created IPRA in 2007 over earlier controversies about how allegations of police misconduct were being investigated by the Office of Professional Standards, an agency within the police department that had been in charge of reviewing major misconduct complaints.

“It is clear that a totally new agency is required to rebuild trust in investigations of officer-involved shootings and the most serious allegations of police misconduct,” Emanuel writes.

The mayor did not offer details about how the new proposed civilian authority would differ from IPRA, but said the framework for his proposal reflected the task force’s recommendations.

Emanuel announced his decision as he faces stiff political headwinds more than five months after the court-ordered release of a video showing a white police officer pumping 16 shots into a black teen, Laquan McDonald, touched off weeks of protests in the city.
