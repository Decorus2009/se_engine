Soon after the task force issued its report, the mayor say he would move to immediately implement about a third of the recommendations, but did not immediately embrace the task force’s call most significant recommendations on overhauling oversight of the police department.

Emanuel also announced that he was backing the task force’s recommendations to appoint an inspector general to monitor policing and create a community safety oversight board – comprised of Chicago city residents – that will be charged with overseeing the city’s entire policy accountability system.

The mayor said his proposal will be formally introduced to the city council on June 22.
